# hello-world
This repository is just a test by me to see how github works.....i've included some very simple programs that i have written.
My Name is Chinedu Iffih....i am a java hobbyist but i like to think of myself as a legit programmer. i have degrees in mechanical engineering, was pre-med for a while nd study computer networking in the army....u can say i might b a scientist.
i have joined github to see how i can expand upon my knowledge of computer programming primarily in java. i love java nd would like to be a complete java professional...i am very dedicated to it nd have all the time in the world.
